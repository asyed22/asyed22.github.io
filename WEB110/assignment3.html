            <h2 style="font-size: 50;">Activity 1</h2>
        </div>

         <p class="x">The first activity was where I had to compare the general usages of search engines such as Google, ask, yahoo, and Bing. I also had to compare the market shares of the engines which told me that Google owns almost all of the market share. This gave me an insight as to what type of search engine most users prefer, one that is well known and does the job of searching their results. Search Engines are also used in day life. When it comes to looking up the news online or when it comes to accessing certain websites that you may need to access for work or school.</p>

         <div class="y">
            <h2  style="font-size: 50;">Activity 2</h2>
        </div>

         <p class="x">In the second activity, I had to use an exact phrase search, as well as a specific site search, and a boolean search, and read an article that explains how to evaluate Internet resources online, to ensure their authenticity. What I have learned from this activity is how modern search engines ensure top searches due to their web targeting algorithm, where it has become so that essentially, searching with quotations, is no longer necessary since you will now more than likely get the result that you are looking for. This made a lot of sense to me since specific web searches gave nearly identical results as unspecified searches. This can be useful to know in everyday life to see how search engines have evolved to provide the most accurate results without any form of specifications needed in most cases to be applied, for the user to find what they are looking for. It can be useful for the user to know these kinds of options to get more specific results as well if they are looking for one particular result instead of relative results.</p>

         <div class="y">
            <h2  style="font-size: 50;">Activity 3</h2>
        </div>

         <p class="x">In the third activity, I got to play around with the citation machines, where different forms of citations would appear, and I had to distinguish the differences between all of the citations. What I learned from this is how I can create online citations. This activity also plays along with the last step of the second activity, where I had to read an article about how to ensure an online article is trustworthy. This can be very helpful in everyday life, especially if you are in school and you need to acquire a trusted article alongside a citation to prevent copyright. </p>
