        <h2>Activity 1</h2>

         <p>In the first activity, I had to go through 3 articles and an activity site where I got on hands experience with HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. There are small codes that essentially engulf texts to be displayed in a certain method, these codes are called elements. There are way too many elements to go over and to even remember all at one time essentially, they allow for the declaration of code and writing, which dictates what is going to be displayed and how it will be displayed on the page. The file must end in .html for it to work and to become a functioning website. Some attributes can attach to elements which can make those elements implement additional aspects into the layout of a site depending on the attribute and the element in use. HTML can help individuals, to develop web pages and customize them to their liking.</p>

         <h2>Activity 2</h2>

         <p>In the second activity, where I had to create a simple webpage about my interests and hobbies. We first start by learning the fundamental elements that aid in the operation of an HTML file. There are 3 main elements of coding in HTML: the doc type on the top which declares what language it will be written in, another key which signifies which part of the document will be typed in the chosen language, and then the body. There is also the usage of attributes that specify how an element must be used, and they are usually used in elements that don't need a close. This can help in the basic construction of paragraphs, insertion of images, Titles, different forms of headers, and more.</p>

         <h2>Activity 3</h2>

         <p>In the third activity, I learned how to debug HTML files to see that all elements and attributes are in check. Much like other codes such as CSS, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Hash, Rust, etc. where there are issues such as syntax and logic errors. The only difference is that, unlike those other languages, it can be harder to determine a syntax error since the HTML language assumes it to be intentional, which must be fixed manually. With syntax errors, you can use a DOM inspector or MVS (markup validation service). The reason why this is useful to know is so that those who use HTML can be aware of easily input syntax errors, where the code will continue to operate regardless, therefore syntax errors must be manually identified, as for logic errors, DOM and MVS can be used to solve it. </p>
