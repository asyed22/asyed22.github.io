         <p class="x">In this assignment, I got to work with HTML code which was a bit confusing for me but I got to the just of it after a day. There are so many things about HTML that overwhelmed me with the amount of codes you can use on it. These cases are known as elements. They are the fundamental structure of HTML. There are elements such as &lt p &gt which allow you to claim a paragraph, &lt html &gt which declares the layout of an HTML file, and &lt!Doctype &gt which declares what language the document will be written in. &lt body &gt allows the insertion of all other elements that can be displayed on a web page, &lt head &gt allows crucial data to be displayed and stored, &lt meta &gt store the important data that can either display important data or specify how the website must be viewed or if it needs to be executed in a certain method by the source code viewer, and &lt title &gt declaring the name of the site page. These are just some of the few fundamental basics to know about HTML, and you must also end all elements with back slashes / where it must look like this in the end &lt /p &gt. These elements can all have activities that could allow specific actions or even customizations to be applied to these elements whether it be individually or in a group depending on the formatting of the program. The most tedious aspect of HTML is the overwhelmingly greater chance of syntax errors that can occur. I had encountered a lot of those which held me back significantly. For instance, some issues weren't too bad after getting used to it but before, there were issues that were difficult to pinpoint, since, unlike most other code such as C++, Python, JavaScript, etc. They possess compilers that can pinpoint syntax and logic errors, with HTML, you have to pinpoint these errors for yourself. From this experience, I can apply these basic fundamental aspects to any HTML file if I plan to make any more websites in the future, which will most indefinitely use HTML. Elements such as! Doctype, HTML, p, title, meta, body, head, and headers 1-6, can allow basic customization and formation onto websites.</p>
