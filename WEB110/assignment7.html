        <H1>Activity 1</H1>

         <p>The first activity gave me 3 articles to read from, one explaining DNS (Domain Name System), one explaining IP (Internet Protocol), and the other explaining the overall structure or reference model of the Internet's network. DNS is responsible for essentially accessing the IP addresses of a website. The local asks the root to which the root has the IP address of the DNS server (.com), then it asks the DNS server again about it, which the DNS server then asks the authoritative server which then gives the IP to the local server which then gives the IP address of the site back to the Internet user. There are also 2 types of IP servers, TCP and UDP. TCP is used for sending data packages in a more organized and secure manner through a laid-out pathway which allows the most efficient data transfer to occur on its servers. UDP on the other hand sends as many datapackages as possible without the usage of laid-out pathways. Two models explain the overall structure of the Internet's networking system: there is the TCP/IP model and the OSI model. The TCP/IP is a much more simplistic model that involves 4 main layers:network access, internet, transport, and application.</p>

         <h1>Activity 2</h1>

         <p>The second activity allowed me to experiment with the ipconfig command, as well as look at network troubleshooting tactics alongside tampering with the TCP/IP settings. What I have learned from this activity is how to configure your ipv4 and ipv6 settings, specifically when it comes to the different methods of changing your IP addresses. There is also troubleshooting your network where you can utilize your command prompt not only for configuring your IPs but also for finding the issue and possibly resolving the issue within your network. The reason why this is useful to know for everyday usage is for privacy concerns if you wish to keep your presence on the internet as unnoticeable as possible, you can always tamper with your IP settings on the command prompt, as well as see why your Internet may not be operational or if it's your device, the website/service you are attempting to access or your isp service provider may also be an issue.</p>

         <h1>Activity 3</h1>

         <p>The third activity asks to share Files with other devices. What I learned from this assignment is sharing a file by creating a secure link inside of your file systems by linking another device onto your device that is sharing. By either choosing to make your file public or private, with a private account you can then choose which device you wish to connect with the file in question. This allows a fairly stable, safe, and especially private connection to the file with the other device for easy access. This can be useful for people who may possess multiple devices such as desktops and laptops to which they need to access files inside of both devices simultaneously through one device. This can allow for easy access to multiple computer systems that have established a link to the host device.</p>
