        <h2>Activity 1</h2>

         <p>The first activity started by downloading a mailing system known as Thunderbird by Mozilla. One element that was new to me and I have learned about is encrypted and stored emails. Thunderbird allows you the option to select pop3, which essentially allows you to download emails onto your computer, or IMAP, which allows your emails to remain on the servers. Either way, Thunderbird allows your mail to be protected, via your system if it is IMAP, then it is encrypted. This can be beneficial for users who use their email systems for more serious matters, for instance receiving bills or perhaps messages about insurance companies, or from banking to ensure that their information doesn't get leaked.</p>

         <h2>Activity 2</h2>

         <p>In the second activity, I investigated some of the security features of Thunderbird, particularly the source viewer, which allows the user to view the source of the mail without opening the mail. What I learned from this was the presence of phishing, spoofing, and spam mail, as well as the differences between the three. This can be very useful especially since as of recent times, spam mails have become more common as well as spoofs from unknown senders posing as well-known companies that you may be signed to, such as your local bank that may be asking you to call them about your checking account, while at the same time having the mail look suspiciously inauthentic. It can allow people to distinguish just by looking at the header of the mail. If the mail is verifiable, then it would be known if it is worth opening without any perceivable consequence, since some spoof or spam mail may contain unknown malware.</p>

         <h2>Activity 3</h2>

         <p>In the third activity, I had to investigate different types of emailing services. Some of the emails that I have investigated were Outlook, Fastmail, Proton, Skiff, and Google. What I learned from investigating is that privacy does matter, and there are reasons why some things can be free out of nowhere, such as Google and Outlook's generous offer of 15 gigabytes of storage on their cloud server for free usersrights. This can be beneficial to know since the reasoning is due to the rights they possess since you are an agreeing user in this case, to your information which they can mine and sell to third-party companies for targeted advertising, which is why I prefer either Proton or Skiff for business inquiries, and Google and Outlook for general usage.</p>
