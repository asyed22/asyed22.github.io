        <h1 class ="y">Final Project</h1>

        <p class = "x">Throughout the course, there were many things that I have learned about the web, some of the most important that stuck out to me were the general function of the Internet, The functionality of data relay, why security is important, and most importantly how web pages are created. When it comes to the case of the operation of the internet, there is much to discuss, from relaying data onto devices, locating proper web addresses through the domain name systems, and then information is then relayed back to the web searcher using their IP address to bring it back to the proper device. It all begins with the request from the user, where they enter the address of a site. The address goes through the internet service provider (ISP), this could be any company to which you are signed up. For instance, it could be AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. It then contacts the domain name systems which withholds all of the names in computer code and can translate the hyperlink which is written in English. Then it asks Top Domain level for the server such as .com, .net, .org, etc. Once the results are found, it is then brought to the DNS which locates the name for instance, www.bananasmoothie, and then returns it as a whole to your ISP, which returns it to you through your device which is found via your IP address, allowing you to access the website. There is also a search engine as well, which allows for the ability to return websites from vague searches. We call those searches quarries. For instance, if you search for "how to make a banana smoothie" you will get a brief description alongside the link to the website providing the information along with other sites with similar results. This is due to the search engine utilizing the quarry and comparing it to the index of sites. Search engines possess the capabilities of performing this task via web crawlers which can go through billions of sites in less than a second! There are also consequences of using the Internet. Since the Internet is open to the world, like the real world, it is open to malware, viruses, scams, worms, etc. to protect yourself from instances such as scams, you must ensure that you do not give away any information unless the site you are on is verified and trusted, you only give out the necessary information. For instance, if you are shopping online, you must enter your credit card. Before you enter your credit card information, you must ensure that your connection is private and secured alongside the page is trustworthy. You can usually verify this by viewing the left corner of your search bar on the web, if there is a lock on it, it verifies a secure connection and a verified website. You should also investigate the motives and history of the website to ensure that it is okay to enter your information and if they are trustworthy. If you wish to secure your op from being in public access, you can also use Virtual Proxy Networks (VPN), which allow for IP addresses to be hidden by fake IP addresses. To ensure you do not obtain a virus, bug, worm, or any form of unauthorized malware, you must ensure that the website to which you are visiting is trustworthy. Generally, this is easy to indicate since untrustworthy websites do not have the padlock and usually have multiple pop-ups every second. Then there is what the whole premise of the course was about which is developing a website. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the main languages used to create a website. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used to structure the general layout of a webpage. With it, you can insert text such as words and numbers, as well as headers, titles for the page, etc. Elements are used which are prompts that are denoted using &lt &gt . Then there is CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to design and make a web page more appealing. You can either link a CSS file onto an HTML file or, add CSS inline an HTML element, or use the &lt style &gt element. You can also directly call upon an element inside of a CSS file to prescribe every single one of that element with the CSS designs that have been assigned to it, as well as by using classes and IDs for more specific elements. JavaScript is responsible for giving behavior to a webpage, for instance, you can make a clock, a mini-game inside of the webpage, interactive images, buttons, etc. It uses boolean expressions such as if, or, and, not, greater than, less than, etc. It is very similar to most programming languages such as Python. It can be linked through HTML for it to be applied, and be tagged to classes or IDs that are tagged to certain elements to which the JavaScript is applied. Overall, this course was a great opportunity for me to understand internet functionality, internet security, the operation of web browsing, and most importantly how to create a web page.</p>
