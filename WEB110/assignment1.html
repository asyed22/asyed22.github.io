         <p class="x">The first assignment is very intriguing to me since it goes over some of the elemental aspects of the Internet. Some of these functions when it comes to the operations of the Internet include delivery in the forms of packages, certain addresses that indicate the direction of those said packages to the correct provider, and through each correct gateway. All the activities I have chosen are a refresher since the introduction offers activities to which all that aren't even in a computer science-related degree understand how to operate. The first activity made me save files on my desktop and inside of folders. It then showed me how to add contents inside of these files and even create subfiles inside of the files. It. Even showed me how to rename files as well as move them around and modify their properties and contents inside of it. It is useful for everyday life, since people need it for work to save work documents that can be from Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel, as well as other different applications. It can also be used to store photos inside which people can keep for memories.</p>

         <p class="x">The next activity shows us how to track your IP addresses alongside telling us the advantages of IP addresses. IP addresses are used to geographically locate any device that operates Internet-based, anywhere in the world. It is not purely accurate but can give a good estimate of the geographical location of a user. IP addresses help with knowing where certain cyber criminals are located. It also allows certain websites to see if the viewers are from the correct location to view the website or to collect data on a visitor's location for proper advertisement promotions.</p>

            <h2  style="font-size: 50;">Activity 3</h2>
        </div>

         <p class="x">The third activity that I chose to do involves using Traceroute, which is embedded inside Windows. This application allows you to see the traffic a certain website may face, which could accurately pinpoint the issue along the direction of the site. A search to a site does not automatically go to the input website, instead, it goes through a series of pathways and servers to get to the site. This can be very useful since it can allow the user to distinguish the issue if a website may have difficulty loading to see if the issue is on your end, the servers, or the website itself.</p>
