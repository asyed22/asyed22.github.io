This assignment was by far the most challenging to me even though there was only one simple objective which was to create a clock. Working with JavaScript is very different than working with CSS and HTML, where HTML creates the general layout of a web page CSS is responsible for the design, and JavaScript is responsible for behavior, where a web developer can make their webpage interactive. Luckily I have a bit of experience when it comes to coding since I have worked with a little bit of Python which is also a behavioral language, the difference is that JavaScript is mainly used for webpages, while Python can be used for other things such as for making small applications or programs. I used the Date function along with a const function to define a variable that can extract data from the system, which data is the current date and time, which is why Date was the most important function. There was also the set interval function which created a loop that ran repeatedly to update the time, if statements were to change AM to PM or change the hour back to 1 if it goes over 12, there is also getElementByID and .innerHTML which allowed for classes and IDs to be defined in the HTML via JavaScript to define the clock. The reason why this was the most difficult assignment for me at the given moment was because unlike other programming languages or even HTML or CSS where you can easily see right in front of your eyes what is visually incorrect, with JavaScript you have to find what is wrong with the program. In my case, the const was defined to have the same name relative to the Date function which was time, which had to be changed back into d, which is why it's difficult to work with programming languages since at times, the smallest mistakes can be so difficult to see but easy to fix, even IDEs can't identify the issues at times. JavaScript can allow for some dynamic interactive elements, such as the case for my website with the clock, where it can aid in making a website more appealing not just visually but interactive but also lively.
