Roster images and Vectr images are two types of images that are applies on online websites, Rosters are the most common which you can find them as JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, BMPs, and TIFFs. JPEGs in short, are files that save the most space since they don't compress and stay in the quality image to ehich they were assigned thus easily losing it's quality quickly once enlarged, PNGS can compress those images and so can TIFFs, when enarges. Both  lose a small amount of quality, the only difference is that TIFFs can stroe more information as layers, while GIFs are ideal for simple images that do not possess as much layers. GIFs are images that are computer animated, where it takes up the most storage since it's a bunch of images stacked up together which like a flip book, create an animation of the image, making the image appear like a very small Audioless video. The file formats I got to work with were JEPGs and PNGs. I used the &lt img &gt element in order to insert images onto my webpage. The image which I used to create my image using an art tool known as Pixlr Editor used PNG as its primary format which I have decided to post the image below this paragraph. There are also Vectr images which don't lose their quality since unlike roster images, where the pixels on an image are defined,  Vectr images uses mathematical alignments that allow for unique creation of simplistic images, that do not lose its quality in sharpness when the image is enlarged. Vectrs are best used for creating abstract online art designs and logos. i chose to place the Vectr image on my main index page since I belived it would be a good looking logo to be on there. I also used the &lt audio &gt element in order to insert an audiko file which I recorded and saved as an mp3 file, which can be played and directly accessed on the website, which I have placed at the top of my WEB110 page. I also used the &lt iframe &gt element in order to insert a YouTube video, and making it playable, whic I have alsk decided to place in my index page to make it more appealing. These elements such as &lt img &gt &lt audio &gt &lt iframe &gt can allow for the webpage to appear more appealing, less empty and mundane. It can also be useful for adding content if for an instance the webpage designers wish to show useful YouTube videos or images or audios that may benefit the webpage viewer depending on the subject of the webpage.
