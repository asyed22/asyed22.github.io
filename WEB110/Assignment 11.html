<p class = "x"> Roster images and Vectr images are two types of images that are applied on online websites, Rosters are the most common and you can find them as JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, BMPs, and TIFFs. JPEGs, in short, are files that save the most space since they don't compress and stay in the quality image to which they were assigned thus easily losing its quality quickly once enlarged, PNGS can compress those images and so can TIFFs, when enarges. Both lose a small amount of quality, the only difference is that TIFFs can store more information as layers, while GIFs are ideal for simple images that do not possess as many layers. GIFs are images that are computer animated, where it takes up the most storage since it's a bunch of images stacked up together which like a flip book, creates an animation of the image, making the image appear like a very small Audioless video. The file formats I got to work with were JEPGs and PNGs. I used the &lt img &gt element to insert images onto my webpage. The image which I used to create my image using an art tool known as Pixlr Editor using PNG as its primary format I have decided to post the image below this paragraph. There are also Vectr images that don't lose their quality since unlike roster images, where the pixels on an image are defined,  Vectr images use mathematical alignments that allow for the unique creation of simplistic images, that do not lose their quality in sharpness when the image is enlarged. Vectrs are best used for creating abstract online art designs and logos. I chose to place the Vectr image on my main index page since I believed it would be a good-looking logo to be on there. I also used the &lt audio &gt element to insert an audio file which I recorded and saved as an mp3 file, which can be played and directly accessed on the website, which I have placed at the top of my WEB110 page. I also used the &lt iframe &gt element to insert a YouTube video and make it playable, which I have also decided to place on my index page to make it more appealing. These elements such as &lt img &gt &lt audio &gt &lt iframe &gt can allow for the webpage to appear more appealing, less empty, and mundane. It can also be useful for adding content if, for instance, the webpage designers wish to show useful YouTube videos images, or audio that may benefit the webpage viewer depending on the subject of the webpage. </p>
