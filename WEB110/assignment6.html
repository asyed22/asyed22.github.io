        <h2>Activity 1</h2>

         <p>The first activity allowed me to compare different communications applications between Skype, Google Meets, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. They all offer MMS messaging systems, calling, and video calling systems which you can make across the world. The only application that charges for calling across the world is Google Meets. I would personally prefer WhatsApp since it's the most used world wide and it's easy to use since you can call and communicate with others anywhere in the world easily, and it's mobile friendly and well organized. I learned about the many different types of e-communication methods that are used on the internet such as MeBean, eBuddy, IMO.me, and technically one of the world's first communication methods known as Internet Relay Chat (IRC). IRC was essentially the bare-bone basic method of communication back in the 1990s before the takeover of texting. It is operated by people creating their private encrypted servers to communicate with one another.</p>

         <h2>Activity 2</h2>

         <p>In the second activity, I had to experiment with remote operating / screen-sharing applications that can essentially allow other Internet users to access other users' platforms to control their devices. What I have learned is how advanced this feature is when it comes to sharing computers across the net. When it comes to delivery, security is a big issue since in essence, an access port is being delivered to a trusted connection that can connect a device to your device over the network. Alongside proper Bandwidth and connectivity, security is a big issue when it comes to screen sharing since the receiver can have access to your device. So there are many proactive steps taken to prevent data breaches from occurring including the usage of multiple servers to provide a safe transfer of data, and an encryption set of some form, to prevent passwords and sniffing data packages, to see their contents and whether or not they are safe to be sent back and forth. Data is also transported on multiple different servers, one, for instance transporting the visually altered data on a rectangular plane, to show the client (the one providing access from their device) and the receiver (the one who has been given access).  The reason why screen sharing is so useful is because, this can provide access to those who are professionals with computers, allowing them access so they can work on other's devices from great physical distances.</p>

         <h2>Activity 3</h2>

         <p>The third activity allowed me to experiment with FTP sites. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which allows users to transfer over files that they may need for any case more than likely to install those certain files onto their website or other applications. FTPs can be acceptable either directly through websites or through clients that you can install onto your device. One huge downside for FTPs is that they aren't secure since it does not have a secure encrypted directory. However, they possess the capability of transferring multiple files almost instantaneously. This can be useful for people who are attempting to download and or install files instantaneously whether it be on their software or a website of some sort, or it can be just some useful files they want to keep for their own sake.</p>
