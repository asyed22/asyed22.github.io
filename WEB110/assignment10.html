         <p class="x" style="color: red;" style="background-color: green;">In this assignment, I got to work with CSS which was the most stressful task throughout working with HTML and CSS, since just like HTML, there are a lot of codes that are used to format and give color and designs to websites, particularly to its paragraphs, texts, images, layouts, margins and so much more. I got to see some of the basic style components such as margins, padding, font size, text aline, font ( color and size), background color, and other components that play out with other basic CS knowledge, such as the RGB and hex value to declare a color. The most tedious aspect that I found to be were syntax errors and a few logic errors too, where some of the text boxes that I created would either be in positions that were not intended to be in or would not display in the correct length due to a mistype in forgetting the label for an instance, px which defines pixels which need to be written behind the number indicating how many pixels are needed. One issue that unfortunately I have no idea how to solve which I wanted to add myself onto my website, even when elements such as border color, border, border width, and padding were entered. There are also these custom elements known as selectors which are essencially much-like functions in code such as Python. It can be used to describe assigned classes, IDs, or elements in HTML to indicate how they will be styled beneath it, which is where the CSS will be written. These are usually written side of external CSS files which are linked onto HTML files to reference off of and implement the dynamic prescribed inside of the selectors. Class and IDs are essentially much like names that are assigned to elements so they can be referenced or reference external files or internal or perhaps even inline code that calls upon it for change. How CSS can be useful for everyday use is for website customizations. These can allow for a mix of certain properties and coloration to diversify and make websites appear less mundane and repetitive to subconsciously stimulate the viewer of a website to stay engaged with the website from its layout created from CSS.</p>
