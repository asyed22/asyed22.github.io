        <h2>Activity 1</h2>

         <p>In the first activity "practicing using web browsers", I went through the provided web browsers on the activity such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Brave. When it comes to web browsing, the setup and the operational process on the surface level seem the same, however, certain deeper elements distinguish and differentiate the browsing experiences from one site to another,  which makes the browsing experiences all the same towards surface level and everyday users. This is the aspect that I have learned from browsing, from watching tutorials to compare and contrast videos, as to why usage of particular browsing applications matters. This can be extremely useful for Internet experts who do not want their information to be tracked and sold to third-party companies for instance, and prefer the most optimal web surfing experience.</p>

         <h2>Activity 2</h2>

         <p>In the second activity where I had to configure the browsing settings between Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Brave, I got to see the different ways of customizing the settings to make it more user-friendly depending on the user's demands. For instance, I have noticed how Chrome offers simplicity to those who just want to browse, Brave and Safari offer data privacy, and with Brave, you customization your privacy preferences as well as your browsing experience, while Opera focuses on setting up your browser in a mannerism that you may be more comfortable with, alongside with enabling a secure free VPN alongside with the browser to prevent your IP address from getting leaked as best as possible. All of these browsers are dependent on how users wish to proceed with their browsing experiences. Whether it be through a simplistic mannerism or if they wanted their data secured or their IP address to be secure, that sensitive information and their location do not get shared with unknown parties.</p>

         <h2>Activity 3</h2>

         <p>In the third activity, I had to append extensions for browsers. All browsers that have been listed so far offer the option of installing an extension even Google Chrome. Extensions are mods that can allow users to diversify their browsing experiences to the user's liking. The ones that I have chosen to install are Grammarly, Internet Speed Checker, Dark Mode, Screencastify, and a VPN. These allow me to better my experience when for instance, the dark mode allows my browsers to look not just to be dark-themed, but also to customized look-wise in the way that I want it, from the color of the text, and link addresses, and the background as well as the font.</p>
