        <H1>Activity 1</H1>

         <p>The first activity was introductory to social media, which took me to a website called Tutorialspoint, which explained the fundamental usage of social media platforms. Social media is used to communicate with not just others who you may know, but with other people around the world and to see what they are doing. Some social media platforms are better than others depending on what the usage is intended for. For instance, LinkedIn is best if you need to create a business account to lure in employers to hire you, Whatsapp is best for sending general messages and communicating with other people across the world since it's the most well-known multimedia application used for communication on a worldwide basis.</p>

         <h1>Activity 2</h1>

         <p>The second activity allowed me to use some of the social media applications of my choice and just experiment with them and see how it operates. I chose to work with Snapchat and Instagram since I am very familiar with the two apps, where essentially they are both apps to post content online. The difference that I have learned between the two social media platforms is that for one, Instagram is more global, where you get to see posts around the world and people around the world can access the content you post on your account if it's not on private mode. Meanwhile, Snapchat is somewhat the same, where you can post content on Snapmaps for the world to see however, unlike Instagram, it is not directly oriented on loading content immediately once you open the app, whereas you also must go onto the Snapmap section to access the global content versus on Instagram, you just open the app. Both apps can be used for everyday purposes, where Instagram is used more so for global connectivity due to direct access to its seamlessly endless content, meanwhile, Snapchat is more about viewing other people's stories from whom you have added, which can be more directly oriented at seeing your friends and family's what about. Both are also great messaging platforms each with its perks, for instance on Instagram, you can send posts to people, whereas on Snapchat, you can make your texts temporarily available, where they can disappear on their own later on.</p>

         <h1>Activity 3</h1>

         <p>The third activity then had me investigate certain social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube. First off, they all have data privacy issues in their unique ways, especially Reddit due to doxxing. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat seem to be the most well-known of all of them. They have easy methods of sharing and of course Community involvement mostly through their comment section. Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, Pinterest, and Linked In, on the other hand, are more text-oriented than it is content-oriented with photographs and videos. LinkedIn and Pinterest attempt to be more professional while Twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit attempt to be more freestyle-like. They are also more community-oriented due to their text-oriented platforms to connect users via text engagement from posts. The content-oriented social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube tend to make it easier to deliver a sponsored message usually via a video post. Meanwhile, they can also do the same on Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, Linkedin, and Pinterest, they also must emphasize a bit more on their text. The honeycomb layout is very important to know, especially for companies who are attempting to promote their products through multiple social media applications in the best conceivable method possible.</p>
