        <h2>Activity 1</h2>

         <p>The first activity presented 2 articles, one brief article explaining the basic understanding of Internet security, and the other being a tutorial on how to be safe on the Internet. Internet security talks about Pshing emails, which are scam emails of third-party individuals who claim to be legitimate companies to get your information, IPSec (Internet Security Protocol) which allows additional security for IP addresses, and SSL (Security Socket Layer). The tutorial talks about how to create strong passwords to prevent account breaches, how to avoid spam and phishing attacks, how to avoid bugs, viruses, and malware to protect your devices and how to deal with them, and how to shop safely so your credit card information is safe, how to improve Wi-Fi security so it doesn't get hacked, how to be safe on social media so unknowns do not collect too much information about you, how to install and update plugins, etc. This can be extremely useful to know since everyone uses the Internet for everyday usage. Whether it be to communicate with others, go on social media to see what's going on, watch TV, play video games, work, shop, etc. It's used for just about anything which is why all of these things are important to know.</p>

         <h2>Activity 2</h2>

         <p>The second activity explains security features on certain browsers. Those browsers include Google, Firefox, and Safari. They all talk about how they manage data privacy, and if data is extracted, what happens with the data, Ad preferences and privacy, password encryptions, cookies data settings, and certain implementations that are applied to browsing to prevent tracking. It also explains how you can customize these settings to your preferences. The reason why this is useful to know is so users of these browsing applications can manage their privacy settings to their specifications, if they feel uncomfortable about their data being handled under default settings or if they wish to know what those settings are, to ensure the best security and privacy under their specifications.</p>

         <h2>Activity 3</h2>

         <p>The third activity allowed me to run a quick experiment with anti-malware software using the EICAR test file which essentially is an acting virus file, to which when an anti-malware software is running, it will identify it as a virus at the very least and then remove it. The reason why this is important to use in day-to-day usage is just to protect devices usually computers from bugs, malware, and viruses that can damage essential hardware that allows the functionality of the device. The EICAR acting as a bait, essentially verifies if the anti-malware software is operational.</p>
